# HouseholderTransformation
This Repository contains the Implementation of Householder Transformation of **Symmetric Matrices** to Tridiagonal Matrices
<br>
and
<br>
Using Changes in sign of Sturm Sequence to obtain Eigen Values of the Transformed Matrix(which are same as the original matrix) with **Non Zero** Sub-Diagonal Elements
<br>
For Details Regarding Theory one may refer the Powerpoint Presentation First
